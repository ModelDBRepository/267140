  This is the NEURON code associated with the paper:<p/>
  Upchurch CM, Combe CL, C Knowlton, V Rousseau, Gasparini S, Canavier CC, (2021) Long-Term Inactivation of Sodium Channels as a Mechanism of Adaptation in CA1 Pyramidal Cells. <br/>
  <p/>
  This model entry was contributed by C Canavier. The freely available NEURON
  simulation enivronment (from <a href="http://www.neuron.yale.edu">http://www.neuron.yale.edu</a>) is required for this model.<p/>
  To use:<br/>
  -------<br/>

  Autolaunch from modeldb if the browser is capable or compile the mod
  files and start with mosinit.hoc (easiest) (If you need more help to run the model,
  please refer to:<br/>

  <a href="https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide.cshtml">https://senselab.med.yale.edu/ModelDB/NEURON_DwnldGuide.cshtml</a>)<p/>
  On linux for example typing<br/>
  nrngui init.hoc
  <br/>
  Will generate 2 panels asking what simulation wou want to run, the first panel will produce simulations from figure 4 and figure 6 of the paper, the second panel will produce simulations from the extended figure 6:<p/>

  <p/>
  running one of these simulations will produce a shape plot, a plot of the applied current, a voltage plot, and if applicable a states plot<p/>

  Additional running notes:<br/>
  -------------------------<br/>
  <p/>


Interspike intervals and frequencies were analyzed offline, as well as Figure 5. sum_currents_of_interest.hoc sums current through Nav1.6 through all parts of the neuron and records it in a text file. sum_capacitive_current.hoc sums capacitive current throughout the neuron and records it in a text file. square_pulse.hoc is a square pulse used to evaluate the input resistance.
